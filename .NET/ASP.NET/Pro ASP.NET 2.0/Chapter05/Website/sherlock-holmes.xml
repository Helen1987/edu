I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as 
free as air -- or as free as an income of eleven shillings 
and sixpence a day will permit a man to be.  Under such 
circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great 
cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire 
are irresistibly drained.

"Holmes is a little too scientific for my 
tastes -- it approaches to cold-bloodedness.  I could imagine 
his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable 
alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply 
out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea 
of the effects.  To do him justice, I think that he would 
take it himself with the same readiness.  He appears to have 
a passion for definite and exact knowledge."

His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.  
Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared 
to know next to nothing.  Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, 
he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had 
done.  My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found 
incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory 
and of the composition of the Solar System.  That any 
civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not 
be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to 
be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly 
realize it.

"You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain 
originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to 
stock it with such furniture as you choose.  A fool takes in 
all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that 
the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, 
or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that 
he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.  Now the 
skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes 
into his brain-attic.  He will have nothing but the tools 
which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has 
a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order.  
It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic 
walls and can distend to any extent.  Depend upon it there comes 
a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something 
that you knew before.  It is of the highest importance, therefore, 
not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."

"From a drop of water," said the writer, "a logician could 
infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without 
having seen or heard of one or the other.  So all life is 
a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are 
shown a single link of it.  Like all other arts, the Science 
of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired 
by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow 
any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.  
Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the 
matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the 
enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems.  
Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to 
distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or 
profession to which he belongs.  Puerile as such an exercise 
may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and 
teaches one where to look and what to look for.  By a man's 
finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser 
knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his 
expression, by his shirt cuffs -- by each of these things a 
man's calling is plainly revealed.  That all united should 
fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is 
almost inconceivable."

"Oh, didn't you know?" he cried, laughing.  "Yes, I have been
guilty of several monographs.  They are all upon technical
subjects.  Here, for example, is one 'Upon the Distinction
between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes.'  In it I enumerate a
hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco,
with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash.  It
is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials,
and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue.  If you
can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done
by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows
your field of search.  To the trained eye there is as much
difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white
fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato."

He was, I take it, the most perfect

were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the
veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained teasoner
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
were as unlike those of Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
possible to conceive.

In his singular character the dual nature
alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
himself to hunt down.

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal
reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a
single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
endeavored in my case to do."

wits' end that his energy and his versatility were

Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for
exercise's sake.  Few men were capable of greater
muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly one of the
finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen; but
he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of
energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save when
there was some professional object to be served.

my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his

ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction.

For years past I have continually been conscious of
some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing
power which forever stands in the way of the law, and
throws its shield over the wrong-doer.  Again and again
in cases of the most varying sorts -- forgery cases,
robberies, murders -- I have felt the presence of this
force, and I have deduced its action in many of those
undiscovered crimes in which I have not been

break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last
the time came when I seized my thread and followed it,

his agents are numerous and splendidly organized.  Is
there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we
will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be
removed -- the word is passed to the Professor, the
matter is organized and carried out.  The agent may be
caught.  In that case money is found for his bail or

The friends of Mr. Sherlock Holmes will be glad to learn that he is
still alive and well, though somewhat crippled by occasional attacks
of rheumatism. He has, for many years, lived in a small farm upon the
downs five miles from Eastbourne, where his time is divided between
philosophy and agriculture. During this period of rest he has refused
the most princely offers to take up various cases, having determined
that his retirement was a permanent one.

Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering
   woman. Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by
   throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her
   remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life
   which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness,
   his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver
   practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific
   experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung
   around him made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other
   hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt that the house might
   have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms
   during the years that I was with him.

I fear that Mr. Sherlock Holmes may become like one of those popular 
tenors who, having outlived their time, are still tempted to make repeated 
farewell bows to their indulgent audiences. This must cease and he must 
go the way of all flesh, material or imaginary. One likes to think that there 
is some fantastic limbo for the children of imagination, some strange, 
impossible place where the beaux of Fielding may still make love to the 
belles of Richardson, where Scott's heroes still may strut, Dickens's 
delightful Cockneys still raise a laugh, and Thackeray's worldlings continue 
to carry on their reprehensible careers. Perhaps in some humble corner of 
such a Valhalla, Sherlock and his Watson may for a time find a place, while 
some more astute sleuth with some even less astute comrade may fill the 
stage which they have vacated.

"I do not go so far as to say that the English are more honest than
any other nation, but I have found them more expensive to buy."

"Our stoker did his business so clumsily that Slater in his struggles
fell off the engine, and though fortune was with us so far that he
broke his neck in the fall, still he remained as a blot upon that
which would otherwise have been one of those complete masterpieces
which are only to be contemplated in silent admiration.  
The criminal expert will find in John Slater the one flaw in all our
admirable combinations.  A man who has had as many triumphs as I can
afford to be frank, and I therefore lay my finger upon John Slater,
and I proclaim him to be a flaw."
