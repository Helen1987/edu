In this lab you will see how to make your service discoverable and how you can discover other services.

    Are you tired of spending hours trying to reproduce and diagnose bugs? Do you have a hard time getting testers and developers to talk to each other? Is it difficult to determine which tests are most important to run after you produce a new build? If so, then this session is for you! Software testing is perhaps the #1 area of investment for the application lifecycle management capabilities of Visual Studio 2010. During this introductory session we explore the new software testing architecture offered by Visual Studio 2010. We examine the various testing roles played by members of the development and testing teams and show how they will interact with Visual Studio 2010 to more effectively test software and eliminate bugs. During part 1 we cover a lot of key testing concepts so that we can hit the ground running with a demo-rich session during part 2 of this presentation. This session was presented by Brian Keller during Microsoft DevDays 2010 in The Hague in The Netherlands.

In this demo-rich session we examine the end-to-end software testing capabilities of Visual Studio 2010. This includes a deep look at manual testing, lab management, data diagnostics adapters, the "actionable bug", functional UI testing, test impact analysis, test automation, and much more which will help you more easily find and eliminate defects from your software. This session is presented by Brian Keller during Microsoft DevDays 2010 in The Hague in The Netherlands.

Once you have learned the basics, in Exercise 2 you will add Razor views in the MVC Music Store solution to provide the same functionality you have in ASP.NET views, but with a clearer and reduced code.
At the end of this lab, in Exercise 3, you will learn how to create and consume third party Razor Helpers.

That filter will catch controller's requests, and save them into a database table. Through a log view you will be able to see the list of visits that each filtered controller had.

In the second exercise, you will add JavaScript code and associate it to the previous custom validation, making the same views run that validation code at client side.

In Object Oriented Programming paradigm, objects work together in a collaboration model where there are contributors and consumers. Naturally, this communication model generates dependencies between objects and components that could became difficult to manage when complexity increases .
You have probably heard about Factory Pattern and the separation between the interface and the implementation using services. However, the client objects are often responsible for service location.
Before introducing the Dependency Injection Pattern, we will explain what Inversion of Control (IoC) principle is. 
With Inversion of Control (Ioc), consumer objects do not create the other objects on which they rely. Those objects come from an external source.

ASP.NET MVC provides action filters for performing logic either before an action method is called or after its run. Action Filters are custom attributes that provide a declarative means to add pre-action and post-action behavior to controller action methods.
In previous versions of MVC, action filters were applied by making a filter attribute and apply it to a controller or an action method. MVC 3 provides the ability to define filters outside that scope, giving the possibility to apply filters to all actions in an MVC application.
In ASP.NET MVC 2 Membership, Authorization and Store Checkout you have been working with the security of your web application. In this Hands-on Lab you will use Global Filters and will apply them to site logging. In order to achieve that, in the first exercise you will learn how to use the filters and how to customize an Attribute filter for global security. Then, in the second exercise you will learn how to create a Global Dynamic Filter by using MVC Filter Providers. That consists in a filter in which execution depends on the context.

Nevertheless, this model implies some costs: you should locate the appropriate software, download and compile it, resolve dependencies of other packages, etc.
With NuGet (http://nuget.codeplex.com) tool, you can download, create, and publish software packages, ready to be used by other developers, resolving the hassles of dependencies tracking. You can use a console tool to create a new package, upload it to a Microsoft server or to a server of your own, browse and install them from Visual Studio.

Testing an application is an automated way of verifying it is always behaving the way it is supposed to. That way, you can later make changes to the code and refactor components without breaking something else somewhere in the application.This Lab will take you through the process of testing controllers in an ASP.NET MVC application, used to verify that actions are working properly.
In this Hands-on Lab, each test is independent from the others, but instead of stubs or mocks, you will be testing the controllers against a well-known database. If needed, that database will be protected by transactions and its initial state will be copied for each test execution, making sure that each test runs with a controlled data set.

    Silverlight started off as a browser plug-in. Since then, Silverlight has emerged as a client platform technology that not only includes browser based applications, but is now a desktop platform as well. This lab is designed to guide Winforms or desktop developers through the process of developing a desktop application in Silverlight. In the lab you'll create a Silverlight web browser. It will truly be a desktop application. Along the way you'll learn how to enable Silverlight out-of-browser, detect the context the application is running in, customize the window, and how to interact with Microsoft Excel.
