In this demo you will go through the different UI Customization possibilities that Office 2010 provides.

The sample code has no functionality, and it is intended to show how you can add items to the Backstage and to the Ribbon in Office 2010. 

All elements rendered can be found in the Ribbon.xml file.
	- Ribbon XML Element contains all the elements that are rendered in the ribbon
	- Backstage XML Element contains all the elements that are render in Backstage
	- ContextMenus XML Element contains the definition of the context menus shown when right-clicking on the spreadsheet.

in order to get acces to the Ribbon elements, place the cursor in the region limited by Row "5" and "8", and columns "C" and "G".
Context Menus also work only inside this region and applies to single cells, not region selections.
