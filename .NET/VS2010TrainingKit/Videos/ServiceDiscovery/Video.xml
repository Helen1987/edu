  <Title>WCF Service Discovery</Title>
  <Description>
    WCF in .NET 4 includes an implementation of the WS-Discovery protocol.  Sounds exciting right?  Actually it is very cool because it allows you to build applications and services that can discover other services using UDP multicast messages or via a discovery proxy.  In this episode I'll walk through the Service Discovery lab where we build a messenger style application I call "ChatWOW".  In this lab you will see how to make your service discoverable and how you can discover other services.
